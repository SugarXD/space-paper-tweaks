## Hey There

They say your worst post is your first post.

This is a dumpster for my ~~Notion~~ Obsidian ramblings. I study and compile all sorts of information on ~~Notion~~ Obsidian while I start on projects. I figured it might be useful, inspirational, insightful, etc to take time to present my work while I'm working on it.

I won’t be posting about “**The Difference between Omit and Exclude in TypeScript**” or “**5 Common Mistakes to Avoid in HTML”.** These are already covered as fluff posts on Medium or they are already covered in various Stack Overflow answers.

This blog isn’t a portfolio piece, its not a vehicle for me to make money, or to find a job - its just a way to learn and have fun while doing it.

Well there's a lot to do, so that's it.
